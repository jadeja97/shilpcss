> an Intent-first, CSS-centric, styling engine and framework. You compose **intent-based styles inside CSS**, and apply them through named classes like traditional CSS. This keeps HTML semantic, readable, smaller in size, and build styling systems meant to last.

It is designed for engineers, who care, where decisions live, who want styles to
remain understandable years later, and who prefer ownership over convenience.

2. [Mental Model](${SITE_URL}/docs/mental-model/)
3. [Quick Overview](${SITE_URL}/docs/quick-overview/)
4. [Benchmarks](${SITE_URL}/docs/benchmarks/)

**Must Read**:

1. [Credits](${SITE_URL}/docs/credits/)
2. [Status](${SITE_URL}/docs/status/)

Once you’ve read the above, you can [Setup Shilp CSS](${SITE_URL}/docs/setup/) to start
using it in practice, or move on to the other sections to deepen your
understanding.

## Source Content (MDX)

If deeper context or raw content is required, the documentation source files are available at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JadejaHQ/shilpcss/refs/heads/main/apps/docs/src/content/docs/**/*.mdx

**Note:** The path or slug derived from a documentation URL may not always match the exact \`.mdx\` filename in the repository. If the \`.mdx\` file cannot be located using the derived path or slug, retrieve the metadata from the corresponding public documentation page instead (for example, \`https://shilpcss.com/docs/colors\`). The page \`<head>\` contains a \`<meta>\` tag with \`type="text/markdown"\` whose \`href\` attribute points to the URL where the actual MDX content is hosted.
